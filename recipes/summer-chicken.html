        This is one of my favorite recipes, completely ripped off
    from an old Kenji Lopez recipe from when he was at Serious Eats
    It's a pretty simple concept, fresh ingredients and quick cooking
    make for a very tender juicy chicken with lots of tangy flavor
    rounded out by the earth fragrant fresh rosemary.

    This recipe essentially uses an emulsified vinagrette with oil
    and lemon juice suspending the chopped garlic and rosemary.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>milanesa sliced chicen breasts</li>
        <li>juice of 2 lemons</li>
        <li>2 tbsp fresh chopped rosemary</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>3 cloves crushed garlic</li>

    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>mix everything except the chicken</li>
        <li>use that mixture on the chicken</li>
        <li>grill or fry the chicken on high heat each side 3 mins</li>
    </ol>
