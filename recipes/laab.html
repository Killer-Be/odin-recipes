    <h2>How to make Lao style Chicken Laab gai aka Larb </h2>

    <p> This is the recipe my Laotian friend Cindy taught me.
        It's full of many elements of umami, tangy, and bright
        fresh ingredients. This is the full recipe but really
        you can omit many steps of this to make it in about 10
        minutes (if you have premade rice) for a quick delicious
         dinner or you can take more prep time and it will have 
         more layers of flavor but take somewhere like 30-45
         minutes.
        </p>

    <p> For any folks out there who may be allergic to ingredients
        such as soy or fish sauce, feel free to substitute out as
        necessary as long as you replace with an equivalent amount of
        a similar flavor.
